# SchoolAssessments

This is a simple scrapper which liberates some data from the www.gov.pe.ca site. Data I wanted was in PDF, I required it to be more consumable. As you can imagine, scrapping a pdf is mostly magic, so there are a lot of data issues which need to be manually cleaned up after running the program.

I do not own any of the data. Please respect the copyright set by the pei government
